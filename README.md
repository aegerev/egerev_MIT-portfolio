## My Portfolio
The UPenn Bootcamp's portfolio was... how to say it... not bad, but also not good. The profile image was all screwed up, there were no images when it came to the project - just a table for the Github Repo and the Deployed Links. IT HASN'T BEEN UPDATED EVER SINCE.

So, I decided to create another portfolio. A portfolio that showcases EVERYTHING - who I am, my education, my work experiences, my projects. 

All of that is on full display in the MIT portfolio - which is THE portfolio that I am sending to employers.

## Sections
There are a total of 6 sections:

* "HOME":
    * This redirects you to my home page.

* "ABOUT":
    * This page showcases everything about me and about the skills I have gained throughout my educational career. 

* "PROJECTS":
    * This page is the "centerpiece" of the entire portfolio. It highlights every single programming project that I did.
    * It follows the "First In, Last Out" method - the current projects are on top, the oldest ones are on the bottom.

* "EDUCATION":
    * This page showcases my education.

* "WORK":
    * This page showcases where I worked and what I did in that work.

* "CONTACT ME":
    * This page is simple. It's nothing more than a Contact Me page.

* "VIEW GITHUB":
    * This page shows you how this website is made by rdirecting you to the site's Github repository.

# MAINTENANCE NOTE
Due to a 'rebranding', several projects may not be available. Even if they are available, they still are in a 'raw format'. **However, please keep in mind that I am updating the projects bit by bit, and all of them will be up and running soon.** Thank you for your attention to this matter.
